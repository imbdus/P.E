# 倒装 

## 1.疑问句和特殊疑问句要倒装
Are you cold?
Does he go to school by bike?
注意：若疑问词在句中作主语或主语的定语时，不倒装。
Who is your English teacher?
Whose father is a worker?

## 2.There be 句型
在There+助动词/情态动词+be+主语+地点/时间的句型中，主语在谓语be动词后面，因此这是倒装。
There was not an underground in Beijing before.
There are not many people who want to read this book..
There will be a basketball match this afternoon.
注意：这种倒装句在There seems/happened/used/lived/came to be等句型中也同样适用。
There came the engineer.
There happened to be a friend of mine in the park.
There once lived an old fisherman in a village by the sea.

## 3.直接引语的全部或一部分放在句首时，引述动词和它的主语有时装。
“May I come in and take a rest?” asked the pool girl.
“Get out of the room!” shouted the angry woman.

## 4. 某些副词开头的句子
以here, there, now, in ,out, up, down, away, then等副词开头的句子中，句子要倒装，以示强调。习惯上，除以then开头的句子用过去时外，其余一般使用现在时。

There goes the bell.铃声响了。
There comes the bus! 汽车来了。
Out rushed the children.孩子们冲出来了。
Now comes your turn.现在轮到你了。
Then came a new difficulty.接着有个新难题。
注意：在这种句型中，如果主语是代词时就不倒装。
Here you are.
There he comes.

## 5. 虚拟条件句的省略与倒装

当if引导的虚拟条件从句中含有had, were, should等时，如将if省略，则要将had, were, should等移到主语前，构成倒装句：
Had you come yesterday, you would have seen him.
若你昨天来，你就会见到他了。
Should you require anything give me a ring.
如果需要什么，可以给我打电话。
Were it not for your help, I would still be homeless.
要不是你帮助，我会仍然无家可归。
注意：省略if后提前的had不一定是助动词：
Had I money, I would buy it. 假若我有钱，我就会买它。
