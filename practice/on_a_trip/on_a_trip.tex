\section{En}

Sichuan is a good place to live and to travel. Because Sichuan has a temperate climate.
And There are various landforms in Sichuan Province, such as mountain,  river, lake, prairie and karst.
It makes me wonder that it is the reason that in Sichuan people have good looking and food have good teste.

I had a trip to Sichuan for about a week longer with my roommates when we were graduated from college.
We began with pandas and delicious food in Chengdu. Attracted by the scenes, we moved to  Jiuzhaigou and Zoige prairie. Finally we went back to Chengdu and moved to Chongqing for better hot pots.

We firstly, following the footprints of general tourism, visited famous historical scenic spots one by one, including Jinli Ancient Street, Chengdu Kuai Zhai Zane, Panda Base, Wuhou Temple and so on. We found that most are as boring as those in other Chinese countries. The famous places to visit had bacome shopping streets. We believed the spirit of City is in the food now. And we will eat as much as we could.
